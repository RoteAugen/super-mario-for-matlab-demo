Super Mario Bros. MATLAB Demo
-----------------------------------------

What it is
----------
This is a short demo of World 1-1 of Super Mario Bros. The demo emulates the behavior of the original NES version as precise as my time and energy allow.

There are no enemies/coins/power-ups. The bricks are not interactive.

The flagpole and castle at the end of the stage are missing. The demo terminates when Mario moves out of the stage on the right.

The music can be turned on before the game starts
----------

Installation 
------------
Regular Version:
    Put stl_mario_main.m and two .mat files under the same folder.
    Run stl_mario_main.m
App Version:
    Just like any all other MATLAB apps
------------

Control
-------
A/D -   Left/Right
J   -   Sprint

How to Quit
-------
1. Walk to the end of the stage, or;
2. Close the figure window
* WARNING: The figure window should shut down itself upon error. If it does not, then you must type 'delete(gcf)' in the command window to manually kill the figure window.

Enjoy!
